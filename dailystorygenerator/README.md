# Daily Story Generator
This application was created in order to generate daily a hero, a villain, an initial story setting and an story objective for role-play.

The user selects a hero and villain pair, and a city, story beginning and story trigger were pulled out randomly to create a daily story to bring about to the day.

There is a very simple example to use, but the force of the application relies in it's customization, where we encourage creativity. 

Enjoy the Daily Story Generator!
